# High Street Gym Dynamic Website Project

This repository contains a school project focused on developing a dynamic website for High Street Gym. The primary objective is to demonstrate the ability to design a website that interacts with a database using XML documents for data transfer.

## Project Overview

As a Web Designer/Developer at Uptown IT, this project simulates the creation of a dynamic website for High Street Gym to manage class bookings and user interactions. The website features user authentication, a class calendar, booking functionalities, and a members' blog.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Includes sign-up, login, and user account management.
- **Gym Classes Calendar**: Displays a schedule of gym classes, allowing users to view available sessions.
- **Class Booking System**: Enables users to book classes, select trainers, and choose session times.
- **Members' Blog**: A platform for members to upload and read messages, fostering community interaction.

## XML Integration

- The project requires the creation and parsing of at least two XML documents to transfer data to the database, such as adding new classes or members.

## Database Design

The database is structured to store information about users, classes, trainers, and the class schedule:

- **Users**: Stores member details like first name, last name, email, and phone number.
- **Classes/Activities**: Includes details like class name, description, location, occupancy, and trainer ID.
- **Class Calendar/Timetable**: Maintains the schedule with details like weekday, time, duration, and class level.
- **Trainers**: Contains trainer information including first name, last name, email, and phone number.

## Technologies

The choice of client-side and server-side languages/platforms is left to the developer, focusing on the best-suited technologies for the project requirements.

## Setup and Installation
